        <h1>So Much FUN!</h1>
        Any monday, wednesday, or friday when the sun is out and it isn't too cold, We're likely to be at
        playground right accross the school. It is one of the simplest joys of our 6th graders to roam free width
        their peers at Commodore Barry park, a nice green space right on Flushing Ave, where self-dismissed student
        can easily catch the bus home. For our 8th grader members of Project Peace, an enrichment and student leadership club, 
        They also go to Commodore Barry park with a purpose. 
        Sustainability and climate change is a big issue for the world and a special concern of 
        the student-led community activism club. Students  can explore
        their Fort Greene neighborhood to investigate and document their subject. At the park, they often
        conducted interviews with local residents.

        Commodore Barry Park is also a community favorite for our track team. In the fall, they often ran outside
        use the park as a free space. The older middle schoolers who self-dismiss may also use to socialize and
        "wait for their friends" after-school. Everyone at Community Roots has memories of Commodore Barry Park 
        because it is such a big part of our school experience. I imagine now that we are in spring  we would be outside for 
        hours enjoying the sun and a bit of fresh air with the some middle schoolers running around.

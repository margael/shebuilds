        My favorite things at Community Roots is that we have a wide breadth of activity
        so students can often reliably find the activity they're interested in whether it be 
        enrichment, leadership-building, academic-support, or team sports.

        I remember in December we were getting ready for our musical debut that both the theatre club and
        stagecraft team had been feverishly working on for months. The musical was "The Green Snake" and every
        role from kitchen mouse to lead character was scrutinized in the audition process as well as in
        preparation for opening night. It was simply a joy to watch children partake in something they really enjoy
        doing from the heart.

        From basketball to soccer. From Jazz band to dance club, we had quite the combination of personalities and 
        activities. I quite enjoyed the small group in photography club. They took some great pictures and experiment
        with interesting methods. One of my favorite creations are the "light sketching" photos they 
        took using a long shutter techniques. They also experimented with subject in photo and more recently with 
        cinematopgraphy.

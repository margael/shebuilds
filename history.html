 My role at Community Roots is coordinated through the Brooklyn College Community Partnership. The BCCP is a 
 community-based organization developed under the scope of the CUNY Research foundation, specifically focused
 on working with school communities to provide resources and programming for school aged children. At CR we 
 run a substantial proogram of enrichment, academic support, and leadership building activies from sports and fitness club,
 to theatre and stagecraft, to Girls Who Code academy. We continue to expand our roster of activities as we worked
 with our participants and learn about their interests. We also competitive team sports like basketball, volleyball, and 
 soccer.

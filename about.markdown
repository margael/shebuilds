  This project was created as a digital space to reflect on my year working with young middle schooler in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. It was quite a year in the halls of Community Roots middle school and I wanted to remember it before the year flies away altogether. CR is a rare educational community where the learning philosophy is centered on desecalating authority and amplifying the voices of individuals. Over the course of the last year, we created many memories and learned many lessons together that shouldn't be forgotten. They are more important than ever at this time. This project is is about me sharing that experience with you.

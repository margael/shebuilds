We no longer greet one another in the hallways, have small talk at the copier, or share jokes in the cafeteria. Part of the glue holding our community together is now threatened by this new distance learning model, especially for young children who find it hard to learn in isolation. What we&#39;re now experiencing with distance learning shows us we have a long way to go in rebuilding those bonds. It is ou biggest challenge at the moment but we have significantly restructured the BCCP experience for our students. However it remains a hard to task to get them to commit their time as they used to before. One of the fun things we now do is incorporate social media platforms like TikTok directly into the acticity. Whether it be dance club or sports and fitness, our students can use it to share their physical skills and creativity. Another digital tool we&#39;ve been using is stop motion studio to develop short animation film with our photography and filmaking ground. the students have really taken to the latter and we&#39;ve seen a growth in participation. We still do not know if and when we will go back to how we operated before. Distance learning has certainly changed what is now possible online. We will ever have another snow day where we just stay home and relax? Is the cat out of the bag on that one? Also how do we continue team sports where everyone is in close contact? These are questions that remain. Pictured- A student in photography class." />

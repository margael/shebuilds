        &lt;h1&gt;So Much FUN!&lt;/h1&gt;
        Any monday, wednesday, or friday when the sun is out and it isn't too cold, We're likely to be at
        playground right accross the school. It is one of the simplest joys of our 6th graders to roam free width
        their peers at Commodore Barry park, a nice green space right on Flushing Ave, where self-dismissed student
        can easily catch the bus home. For our 8th grader members of Project Peace, an enrichment and student leadership club, 
        They also go to Commodore Barry park with a purpose. 
        Sustainability and climate change is a big issue for the world and a special concern of 
        the student-led community activism club. Students  can explore
        their Fort Greene neighborhood to investigate and document their subject. At the park, they often
        conducted interviews with local residents.
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Commodore Barry Park is also a community favorite for our track team. In the fall, they often ran outside
        use the park as a free space. The older middle schoolers who self-dismiss may also use to socialize and
        &quot;wait for their friends&quot; after-school. Everyone at Community Roots has memories of Commodore Barry Park 
        because it is such a big part of our school experience. I imagine now that we are in spring  we would be outside for 
        hours enjoying the sun and a bit of fresh air with the some middle schoolers running around.

        My favorite things at Community Roots is that we have a wide breadth of activity
        so students can often reliably find the activity they're interested in whether it be 
        enrichment, leadership-building, academic-support, or team sports. 
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        I remember in December we were getting ready for our musical debut that both the theatre club and
        stagecraft team had been feverishly working on for months. The musical was &quot;The Green Snake&quot; and every
        role from kitchen mouse to lead character was scrutinized in the audition process as well as in
        preparation for opening night. It was simply a joy to watch children partake in something they really enjoy
        doing from the heart.
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        From basketball to soccer. From Jazz band to dance club, we had quite the combination of personalities and 
        activities. I quite enjoyed the small group in photography club. They took some great pictures and experiment
        with interesting methods. One of my favorite creations are the &quot;light sketching&quot; photos they 
        took using a long shutter techniques. They also experimented with subject in photo and more recently with 
        cinematopgraphy.
    &lt;/articlemain&gt;

   Coronovirus has upended our lives and shaken our communities. We no longer greet one another in the hallways, have small talk at the copier, or share jokes in the cafeteria. Part of the glue holding our community together is now threatened by this new distance learning model, especially for young children who find it hard to learn in isolation. What we're now experiencing with distance learning shows us we have a long way to go in rebuilding those bonds.  It is ou biggest challenge at the moment but we have significantly restructured the BCCP experience for our students. However it remains a hard to task to get them to commit their time as they used to before. 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
   One of the fun things we now do is incorporate social media platforms like TikTok directly into the acticity. Whether it be dance club or sports and fitness, our students can use it to share their physical skills and creativity. Another digital tool we've been using is stop motion studio to develop short animation film with our photography and filmaking ground. the students have really taken to the latter and we've seen a growth in participation. 
   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
   We still do not know if and when we will go back to how we operated before. Distance learning has certainly changed what is now possible online. We will ever have another snow day where we just stay home and relax? Is the cat out of the bag on that one? Also how do we continue team sports where everyone is in close contact? These are questions that remain.
